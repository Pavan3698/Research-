How do data science applied with artificial intelligence to create value in businesses
Context: Data science has a vital role to play in an organization. Whereas, artificial intelligence need more application-oriented skills to create value.

# PICO Elements:

## Problem:

Analytics of data science powers business intelligence and marketing program efforts. However, the amount of value actually received from the data is a concern. Here, artificial intelligence is helpful. This is from a large set of data and creating predictions as per the data (Wang et al. 2020). It comprises analytics data from various areas such as CRMS, content management systems, automation platforms and Google Analytics. According to studies, business values are estimated to reach 3.9 trillion dollars by 2022 through AI. 

## Intervention:

It has been essential to understand how the introduction of AI at the business level is making things simpler. Also, it is to be analyzed how it is helping them to expand and grow. Here, the key issue lies in the nature of predictive model of the solution. For becoming actual AI, a productive model requires learning and development from its various predictions (Ojanperä, O’Clery and Graham 2018). Predictive analytics from data science indicates that machines predicted as per data and prescribed things to be done further. 

## Comparison: 
  The two interpretations are provided below. 
### Interpretation 1: 
  Area of AI is yet to be explored, whereas data science has already begun to make a huge difference in market (Bile Hassan et al. 2021). Through interpreting the growth of AI, new products are generated that are bringing autonomy through performing various things in an automatic way. 
### Interpretation 2: 
  Through interpreting data science, data can be analysed as per business decisions as AI is implemented to provide value to companies.

## Outcome:
a. Different tasks on data are done through data science algorithms. These are deployed in languages such as Python. Hence, data science has a vital role to play in an organization. Thus, they need more application-oriented skills in artificial intelligence. 
b. Moreover, data scientists should know libraries and tools in data science. This is for building models in AI and to create advanced applications.
